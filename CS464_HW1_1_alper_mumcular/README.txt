In order to run this Python file, you can use Python3.9 (I used Python 3.6.0 if you have any problems due to the version, you can also try in this version).
Also you need to install pandas (version 1.5.3) and numpy (1.24.2) libraries.
You also need to set the file locations (for train and test datasets.) (It is assumed that they are in the same directory)

It will be better to run in a PyCharm project. It does not work in Windows terminal (It gives nonsense errors).
There is a environment.yml file which helps you to build the necessary environemnt to run the python code. (If you open this python file in PyCharm it detecs automatically conda environment, you can build the environment in that way). 

Also you can use "Anaconda Powershell Prompt". If you do in this way, please apply these:
1- go to this project directory from terminal
2- type "conda env create -f environment.yml"
3- type "conda activate cs464_hw1"
4- type "python q3main.py"

In the case of you cannot run, I can show the desired outputs in my computer remotely (on Zoom) or face-to-face (in your office).

You don't need to do anything more than these.
